# Decentralized Capooling with Solidity on Polygon

Carpooling is quite expensive (overcharged +30%) and has not innovated a lot for years because there is a monopoly.

This project proposes a solution to avoid it using Polygon's blockchain, with smart contract (Solidity) tested (Truffle).
(Here is the web interface using Web3 and ruby: https://github.com/olivier7delf/carpooling-ror)

Tech: 
- Solidity - 0.5.16 (solc-js)
- Truffle v5.4.18 (core: 5.4.18)
- Node v14.18.0
- Web3.js v1.5.3
- Ganache app
- yarn 1.22.13

## 1) Project description

It is a small Proof of Concept (POC) to validate the feasibility of decentralized carpooling on a technical aspect.
The main idea is to keep things simple and flexible so that other services can interact with them, which facilitates innovation.

It is related to a wider idea described in https://medium.com/@Olivier-Delfosse/how-to-unleash-carpooling-potential-decentralization-f1db8b308d2d, in the article, we assume another architecture to lower-cost described in "4. Next steps".

The carpooling apps can:
- Share their offers and use others
- Add services to a carpool, e.g: id check, insurance

The services can easily be registered as safe to be used by drivers and passengers without third-party help.

## 2) Architecture and business model

The project is composed of two smart contracts:
- CarpoolingFactory:
  - carpoolings are registered here
  - services have to been registered as safe to be used
- Carpooling:
  - Manage carpooling
  - Manage services linked to one carpooling


Carpooling contract is split in 5 main classes:
1. CreatingCarpooling
2. BookingCarpooling
3. ManagingServices
4. ManagingCarpooling: functions requiring (2) & (3) inheritances
5. Carpooling: mostly used to withdraw tokens and "getter" functions

MetaVariable class contains variables used by both contracts.
CarpoolingFactoryAbstract is used by Carpooling to add a service.

**Smart contract architecture:**

**Business model: incentivize offers sharing by apps**

To do margin, apps can increase slightly their price.

In this case, App1 shares an offer with a 1€ margin each time someone book a carpooling through the smart contract.

Other incentives can be imagined, e.g: giving access to more offers depending on the number of offers shared by the app. 
But it would limit the openness of the solution. 

## 3) Deploy and use the contracts

### a- Edit and test the contracts
To edit the contract, or test it localy, it requires:
- npm: ganache-time-traveler, @truffle/hdwallet-provider

**Run tests:**

Start Ganache, make sure you have the right configurations that match between Ganache's app and "./truffle-config.js".
Then you can run the tests:
>truffle test ./test/carpooling.js

**Deploy**

You can deploy it on a blockchain using truffle or remix: https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create_deploy.html

Deploy on dev network: Mumbai

>truffle deploy --network maticmumbai 

Deploy on main network:

>truffle deploy --network maticmainnet

### b- Functionalities overview

**Create a carpoolingFactory:**

Deploy the factory contract "CarpoolingFactory" on an Ethereum compatible blockchain, e.g: Polygon (gas used: 4,854,473; cost ~0.33€).
Services can ask to be integrated into the safe repository, it is required to be used in carpooling.
Admin of carpoolingFactory (instance) can validate or not these services.

**Create a carpooling:**
Through carpoolingFactory, drivers create carpooling (child contract) using the function "createCarpooling" between two cities.
(gas used: 4,007,441; cost ~0.27€)

Input, e.g: "Nantes","Bordeaux",3,20,1636830368,0xC39F595D9ad5b208988674B7c502e0f5c69a32Ab,0 
(Caution, the price should be put in wei)

Users can :
- Book a carpooling using "makeBooking" with the number of seats desired and pay the right amount. (cost ~0.01€)
- Ask to add a service, as id check or insurance. They are not coded.
The funds are locked on the smart contract.

Then, we assume the services are listening to carpoolingFactory, to get notified if they have a pending request from users.
They have to answer it by validating or not the request. 
We assume in the design that to subscribe to it, we just need to register its address and lock the amount of tokens needed.

After that, anyone can call "validateBooking" and the passenger request is now accepted or he is refunded.

When the carpooling ride start, passengers can validate it. 
The driver and services can withdraw their payment in tokens.

## 4) Next steps

TODO:
- Find collaborators and contacts third parties: list their main needs
- Refactor the code:
  - Change the architecture into a single smart contract, it will reduce the cost to create a new carpooling from 0.38€ to ~0.02€. 
  - It should allow to create an itinary with more than 2 cities...
- Review the security of the code, optimization and do an audit
